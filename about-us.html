            <p class="hero-text">My fitness journey started like many of you, at a time I was run down, overweight and
              depressed. I had never been all that athletic or involved in sports growing up, but I knew I needed a
              change. Over the years I learned about sustainable nutrition, and fitness became my passion. Starting off
              with running in 2010 and later in 2012 I was introduced to CrossFit and my idea of fitness was forever
              changed. I believe strongly Greg Glassman’s statement, “the <strong> needs </strong> of Olympic <strong>athletes</strong>
              and our grandparents <strong>differ by degree, not kind “</strong> We all benefit from moving well and
              with good mechanics, developing strength, agility, coordination and all the other aspects of Fitness. At
              the end of 2013 I received my CrossFit Level 1 certification and in 2014 I received my CrossFit kids
              certification and began coaching adults, teens and children at CrossFit Iron City. I enjoy expressing my
              fitness by competing in local competitions as a masters athlete.
            </p>

            <p class="hero-text">
              In 2018, I obtained my CrossFit Level 2 trainer certification. It was at that time the dream of opening
              my own facility was born. I envisioned a clean, family friendly space open to the community with the goal
              to support health and fitness habits across the lifespan. A place that is broad, inclusive, welcoming and
              supportive. We know how hard it is to start, but once you start we hope you’ll never leave.

              was doing mainsite WODs at the YMCA. In the spring of 2015 I joined CrossFit North Park and became a
              coach in summer 2017. In addition to my Level 1 I have also earned the CrossFit Weightlifting Course
              Certificate in the fall of 2018. I am always learning new techniques to expand my knowledge of anything
              CrossFit related to bring back to the box.

            <p class="hero-text"> I started CrossFit in August 2012 after seeing the CrossFit games broadcasted on
              ESPN. From that point on, I looked up the closest gym at the time which was CrossFit Iron City and my
              journey to a fitter me started. Through the years, I expanded my knowledge of CrossFit in obtaining my
              L-1 Certification and an additional Nutrition Certification through OPEX. I have always had an interest
              in Fitness and will find myself reading research articles and watching videos always trying to expand my
              knowledge. Outside of the gym, I enjoy spending quality time with my wife Sierra and my dog Eva, watching
              or playing sports, attending music concerts and spending time outdoors.

              Crossfit - Spot the Flaw</h4>
            <p class="hero-text"> I grew up playing sports and continued to do so through high school. After high
              school I spent my time lifting weights and running to fulfill my fitness needs. Over time I began to feel
              like my workout routine was growing stagnant and I needed a change, so I decided to try Crossfit. </p>


            <p class="hero-text"> I did my first Crossfit workout on November 2, 2016 and I fell in love instantly. I
              obtained my L-1 Certificate to Coach CrossFit in September 2018 and I began coaching in November 2018.
              While I don’t expect everyone to instantly fall in love with Crossfit like I did, I know that my passion
              and knowledge of the Crossfit methodology allows me to be an effective coach who enjoys helping people
              change their lives using CrossFit. </p>

            <p class="hero-text"> My goal as a coach is to help our athletes move safely and effectively while
              improving the quality of their lives. I enjoy the process of seeing athletes grow and progress both
              physically and mentally using the Crossfit methodology. I truly believe that Crossfit is for anyone of
              any age and background and I look forward to providing athletes with the best hour of their day each time
              they walk into our gym.
